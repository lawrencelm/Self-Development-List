# Self-Development-List
Compilation of best advice read/received and things I want to improve on. I will keep adding things I read to this list and updating it. I can only remove something from the list once I have solved the issue or really improved.

1. NO DISTRACTIONS
  * Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don’t really matter.  It’s hard to overstate how important this is, and how bad most people are at it.  Get rid of distractions in your life.  Develop very strong ways to avoid letting crap you don’t like doing pile up and take your mental cycles, especially in your work life.
2. Keep your personal burn rate low
 * Keep your personal burn rate low.  This alone will give you a lot of opportunities in life.
3. Never Touch Things Twice/10 Minutes Rule
4. Have daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly and long-term goals
 * Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year, and every decade. 
 * Put together a 'dreamboard', with all the things that you want in your life.  Then write a list of everything you think might stop you and then write out action plans of things you need to do, step-by-step, to overcome those obstacles.
5. Eat Frogs and Fight The Tyranny Of The Urgent
 * do the least appetizing, most dreaded item on their to-do list before they do anything else.
 * the tyranny of the urgent refers to the tendency of little things that have to be done right now to get in the way of what really matters. This creates a huge problem as urgent actions often have little impact.
6. Stick to the Schedule During Meetings (30 min meetings)
7. Be obsessed. Be obsessed. Be obsessed. Be obsessed. 
8. Say No
 * “No matter how much money you have, you can’t buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone’s day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn’t let his calendar get filled up with useless meetings. On the other hand, he’s very generous with his time for the people he trusts.”
10. Make meaningful connections
11. Only Check E-mail At Designated Times
12. Delegate
13. Give honest and sincere appreciation
14. Become genuinely interested in other people
15. Remember a person's name
16. Talk to people more. Read more long content and less tweets. Watch less TV.  Spend less time on the Internet
More paper. Less digital
17. Don’t waste time.  Most people waste most of their time, especially in business.
18. If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it.  Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.  When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.
 * If I could sit down with my 22-year-old self, I would tell her about the sign in the Lean In office that reads, “Proceed and be bold,” and I'd encourage her to wake up each morning and do just that. I would admit that boldness has its downsides, like big mistakes and really bad decisions. But I’d assure her that things will work out if she trusts her gut and does everything with gusto. 
 * “Fortune favors the bold.”
 * You Miss 100% of the Shots You Don't Take
19. Exercise.  Eat well.  Sleep.  Get out into nature with some regularity.
Go out of your way to help people.  Few things in life are as satisfying.  Be nice to strangers.  Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.
20. Learn voraciously. 
 * Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
21. Do new things often.  This seems to be really important.  Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think.  Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life.
22. Be a doer, not a talker.
23. The only person you have to beat is you. That's not some hippy-dippy 'believe in yourself' bullshit, it's how you win. 
24. Being a "Genius" isn't about high IQ or great grades, it's about having a level of insight in areas which is well beyond what others have.

If you're bored, try making it all interesting again, don't consider learning as being for 'learning sake', instead seek to deepen your insight so that you can do the "cool stuff" which leaves the rest of us in awe.

25. You need a good target. A tough one. Something that can keep you engaged and make your thoughts streamline. Others will achieve, don’t be affected.

26. "In a concentrated population of intelligent people, the worst thing you can do is start comparisons and compete head to head."
You have to find your niche, the one or two things you're good at doing (and more importantly, enjoy doing). Excel in those and you'll find that you love learning again.

27. Forget the metrics, grade curves for a moment... focus on a temporal timeline of your own personal growth.
What have you learned with each passing day, month or year?
Have you enriched your own skillset or are pining for the good old days of high school when you were the big kahuna?
My personal philosophy has always been to never compare or compete, but to focus on my own intellectual growth.
Work towards learning and being happy, the rest will fall into place.
Look at the positive side: There are Teachers all around you (and I just don't mean the ones on the payroll). You have an opportunity to pick the brains of  an intelligent elite. If you can choose to be mentored by them and learn from them, you'll end up with a skillset that most would envy.
